# REACT-JS
CURD APPLICATION 
The idea is to build a small CRUD app for managing students details 

There is a dashboard that lists all students’ names and details 

Next to each student, there is an icon that opens options like Edit or Delete

Edit should open a dialog box on the same page where you can see all details of the student, edit them, and save

Delete should remove the student

At the top of the dashboard, there should be a Create New button which opens a form to add a new student

Fields for the Create or Edit Student form can be

Student ID which can be auto-generated or entered manually

Name

Email

Mobile Number

Gender like Male, Female, or Other

Date of Birth

Address

also on edit and create new on enter focus will be go on next filled 

Basically it’s a simple and dynamic React CRUD applications
